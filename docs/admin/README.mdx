# Admin Guide

This guide covers everything you need to know about administering the Percy Main Community Sports Club website.

## Who is this for?

This documentation is for club members with the <RoleBadge role="admin" /> role. Admins have full access to manage members, payments, sponsorships, and site content.

There is also a <RoleBadge role="junior-manager" /> role for people who manage junior teams — see [Junior Managers](junior-managers.mdx) for details.

## Accessing the Admin Panel

1. Log in to the website at [percymain.org](https://percymain.org)
2. Navigate to `/admin` or click **Admin Panel** in the members area
3. You must have the admin role — regular members are redirected to the members area

## Admin Panel Tabs

The admin panel is organised into seven tabs:

| Tab | Purpose | Guide |
