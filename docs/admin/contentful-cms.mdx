# Contentful CMS

The website's public content — news articles, pages, events, and people profiles — is managed in [Contentful](https://app.contentful.com), a cloud-based content management system.

<Callout type="info">
Contentful is separate from the admin panel. You access it at [app.contentful.com](https://app.contentful.com) with your own login credentials. Ask an existing admin for an invitation if you don't have access.

## How Content Gets to the Website

Content changes in Contentful are **not instant** on the live website. The website is statically generated, meaning it's rebuilt when code changes are pushed. To see content changes:

1. Make your changes in Contentful
2. The site will pick up the changes on the next deployment

<Callout type="info">
If you need content changes to appear urgently, ask a developer to trigger a rebuild.

## Tips

- **Use descriptive slugs** — they become part of the URL and help with search engines
- **Optimise images** — upload reasonably sized images. Very large files slow down the site
- **Rich text** — use the formatting toolbar for headings, bold, italic, lists, and links. You can embed images directly in rich text fields
- **Preview** — Contentful has a preview feature to see how your content will look before publishing
