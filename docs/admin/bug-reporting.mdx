# Bug Reporting

Found a bug or have a feature request? Here's how to report it.

## Reporting via GitHub Issues

All bug reports and feature requests are tracked on GitHub Issues:

**[github.com/percy-main/web/issues](https://github.com/percy-main/web/issues)**

### Creating a Bug Report

1. Go to the [issues page](https://github.com/percy-main/web/issues)
2. Click **New issue**
3. Give it a clear, descriptive title (e.g. "Membership payment page shows wrong amount" rather than "Payment broken")
4. In the description, include:
   - **What happened** — describe the problem
   - **What you expected** — what should have happened instead
   - **Steps to reproduce** — how can someone else see the same issue?
   - **Screenshots** — if applicable, attach screenshots showing the problem
   - **Browser** — which browser you were using (Chrome, Safari, Firefox, etc.)
5. Click **Submit new issue**

### Creating a Feature Request

1. Go to the [issues page](https://github.com/percy-main/web/issues)
2. Click **New issue**
3. Use a title that describes the feature (e.g. "Add ability to export member list as CSV")
4. Explain:
   - **What** you'd like to see
   - **Why** it would be useful
   - Any ideas about **how** it could work

## What Happens Next

- A developer will review the issue and may ask follow-up questions
- Bug fixes are prioritised based on severity and impact
- Feature requests are discussed and scheduled into future work

<Callout type="info">
You'll need a GitHub account to create issues. If you don't have one, ask another admin to create the issue on your behalf, or email the details to a developer.
</Callout>

## Urgent Issues

For urgent issues that affect the live website (e.g. the site is down, payments aren't working), contact a developer directly rather than waiting for a GitHub issue to be triaged.
