## Member List

The Members tab shows a paginated table of all registered users. Each row displays:

| Column | Description |

| **Name** | The user's full name |
| **Email** | Their email address |
| **Member** | Green "Member" badge if they have a member record, red "Not Member" otherwise |

| **Membership Type** | The type of membership (e.g. adult, junior) |
| **Role** | Their system role — <RoleBadge role="admin" />, <RoleBadge role="user" />, or <RoleBadge role="junior-manager" /> |

### Searching

Use the search box to filter by **name** or **email**. The search updates as you type (with a short delay).

### Pagination

Results are shown 20 per page. Use the **Previous** and **Next** buttons to navigate. The total user count is displayed.

## Member Detail

Click any row to open the member detail modal. This shows everything about a user across several sections.

### Account Information

- Name, email, role
- Whether their email is verified
- Account creation date

### Role Management

You can promote a regular user to admin or demote an admin to a regular user:

1. Click **Promote to Admin** or **Demote to User**
2. Confirm the action in the confirmation dialog
3. The role change takes effect immediately

<Callout type="info">
The Promote/Demote button only toggles between the <RoleBadge role="user" /> and <RoleBadge role="admin" /> roles. To assign the <RoleBadge role="junior-manager" /> role, use the **Junior Manager** section lower in the same modal — see [Junior Managers](junior-managers.mdx).
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning">
Changing a user's role to admin gives them full access to all admin features. Only do this for trusted club officials.
