# Junior Managers

The <RoleBadge role="junior-manager" /> role gives specific people the ability to view and manage the junior teams they're responsible for, without needing full admin access.

## What Junior Managers Can Do

Junior managers have access to a dedicated **Junior Manager Panel** at `/junior-manager` where they can:

- View the teams they've been assigned to
- See all players in their teams (age-appropriate filtering)
- View player details (contact info, medical info, etc.)

They **cannot** access the main admin panel or any other admin features.

## Assigning the Junior Manager Role

<RoleBadge role="admin" /> Only admins can assign the junior manager role.

1. Go to the **Members** tab in the admin panel
2. Find the user and click their row to open the detail modal
3. Scroll to the **Junior Manager** section
4. Select the teams they should manage using the checkboxes
5. Click **Save Team Assignments**

The user's role is automatically changed to <RoleBadge role="junior-manager" /> when teams are assigned.

<Callout type="info">
Admins always have full access to all teams. If a user has the admin role, you'll see a message saying "Admins have full access to all teams. Demote to User first to assign specific teams."
</Callout>

## Removing Team Assignments

To remove a junior manager's access:

1. Open their member detail modal
2. Deselect all teams, or click **Remove All Teams**
3. Their role automatically reverts to <RoleBadge role="user" />

## Junior Manager Panel

When a junior manager logs in, they can access `/junior-manager` to see:

- A list of their assigned teams
- Click a team to see all players in that team
- Player details including contact information for parents/guardians
