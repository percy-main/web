## Overview

Members of the public can sponsor individual cricket matches through the website. When someone submits a sponsorship, it goes through an approval workflow before appearing on the site.

## Sponsorship Statuses

| Status | Badge | Meaning |
|--------|-------|---------|
| **Pending Payment** | Red | Sponsor has submitted but not yet paid |
| **Pending Approval** | Yellow | Payment received, awaiting admin approval |
| **Approved** | Green | Sponsorship is live on the website |

## Filtering

Use the status filter to view sponsorships by their current state: All, Pending Payment, Pending Approval, or Approved.

## Sponsorships Table

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Game** | Date, team, and opposition (with Home/Away indicator) |
| **Sponsor** | Sponsor name and logo preview |
| **Amount** | Amount in GBP |
| **Status** | Current status badge |
| **Paid** | Payment date or "-" |
| **Message** | The sponsor's message (expandable if long) |
| **Actions** | Context-dependent action buttons |

## Approval Workflow

### Approving a Sponsorship

When a sponsorship has status **Pending Approval** (payment has been received):

1. Review the sponsor details, message, and logo
2. Click **Approve** to make it live on the website

The sponsorship will now show with a green "Approved" badge and appear on the game's page on the website.

### Revoking a Sponsorship

If an approved sponsorship needs to be taken down:

1. Click **Revoke** on the approved sponsorship
2. The sponsorship returns to **Pending Approval** status and is removed from the public website

You can re-approve it later if needed.

## Editing a Sponsorship

Click **Edit** to modify any sponsorship. You can update:

- Sponsor name, email, and website
- Logo (with image preview)
- Sponsor message
- Amount
- Display name (overrides the sponsor name shown publicly)
- Internal notes

## Creating a Manual Sponsorship

For sponsorships arranged offline (e.g. at the club, via email), you can create them directly:

1. Click **Create Manual Sponsorship**
2. Search for the game by opponent name and select it
3. Fill in the sponsor details:
   - **Sponsor Name** (required)
   - **Sponsor Email** (required)
