<AdminTab name="Juniors">
View all junior players grouped by team, with filters for age group, gender, and membership status.
</AdminTab>

## Overview

The Juniors tab shows all registered junior members (dependents), grouped by their team assignment. This gives you a quick overview of every junior in the club.

## Filters

Four filter controls are available at the top:

| Filter | Options |
|--------|---------|
| **Search** | Search by junior or parent name |
| **Age Group** | All Age Groups, or a specific age group (e.g. U11, U13) |
| **Gender** | All Genders, Boys, Girls |
| **Membership** | All Memberships, Paid, Unpaid |

A summary line shows "Showing X of Y junior(s)" and updates as you change filters.

## Team Cards

Juniors are grouped into collapsible team cards (e.g. "U11 Boys", "U13 Girls"). Each card shows:

- **Team name** with a count badge showing how many juniors are in that team
- Click to **expand/collapse** the team's player list

An "Overage" group appears at the end for juniors who don't fit into a standard age group.

## Player Information

Within each team card, a table shows:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Name** | The junior's full name |
| **DOB** | Date of birth |
| **Parent** | Name of the parent/guardian who registered them |
| **Contact** | Parent's email (clickable mailto link) and telephone number |
| **Membership** | Green "Paid" or red "Unpaid" badge, with paid-until date if applicable |
