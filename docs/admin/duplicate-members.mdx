# Duplicate Members

<AdminTab name="Duplicates">
Find and safely merge duplicate member records.
</AdminTab>

## How Duplicates are Detected

The system identifies potential duplicates using two methods:

| Method | Confidence | Badge |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| **Email match** | High — same email on multiple records | Green "Email match" |
| **Name match** | Lower — fuzzy name matching (70%+ similarity) | Yellow "Name match" |

## Duplicate Groups

Each group shows the matching records with:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Keep** | Radio button to select which record to retain |
| **ID** | Truncated record ID |
| **Name** | Full name |
| **Stripe** | Whether the record has a Stripe customer ID |
| **Memberships** | Count of membership records |
| **Dependents** | Count of junior members |
| **Charges** | Count of charges |

## Merge Workflow

Merging combines two records into one. The record you select as "Keep" is retained, and all data from the other record is moved to it.

### Step 1: Select the Record to Keep

Choose which record should be the primary one by clicking its **Keep** radio button. Consider:

- Which has more complete personal details?
- Which has the Stripe customer ID?
- Which has more memberships, dependents, or charges?

### Step 2: Preview the Merge

Click **Merge** to see a side-by-side preview showing:

- **Left (green)** — the record being kept, with all its details
- **Right (red)** — the record being removed

The preview also shows what will happen:

- "X membership(s) will be moved..."
- "X dependent(s) will be moved..."
- "X charge(s) will be moved..."
- "Stripe customer ID will be copied..." (if the removed record has one)
- "The duplicate member record will be deleted"

### Step 3: Confirm

To prevent accidental merges, you must type a confirmation word:

- For records with the **same email**: type `merge`
- For records with **different emails**: type `MERGE` (uppercase)

<Callout type="danger">
Merging is permanent and cannot be undone. Always verify that the two records genuinely belong to the same person before confirming, especially when emails differ.
</Callout>

### Cross-Email Merges

When merging records with different email addresses, an amber warning appears showing both emails and asking you to verify they are the same person. The uppercase `MERGE` confirmation adds an extra layer of safety.
